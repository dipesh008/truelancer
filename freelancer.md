A <a href="https://www.truelancer.com/freelancers" >Freelancer</a> or freelance worker is a term commonly used for a person who is self-employed and is not necessarily committed to a particular employer long-term. Freelance workers are sometimes represented by a company or a temporary agency that resells freelance labor to clients; others work independently or use professional associations or websites to get work.

While the term "independent contractor" would be used in a higher register of English to designate the tax and employment class of this type of worker, the term <a href="https://www.truelancer.com" >freelancing</a> is most common in culture and creative industries and this term specifically motions to participation therein.
